				    	<p>When all eyes are adoring you and your bridal party , it's good to know we've taken the extra time to proportion your dresses, so a size six fits as glamorously as a sixteen. Here are a few things to keep in mind when getting fitted or altering your Watters dress.</p>

						<p><strong>MEASUREMENTS</strong></p>

						<p>We recommend your measurements be taken by a professional seamstress or your authorized Watters retailer for an accurate fit. Be sure your measurements are taken over undergarments for a more precise measurement. Please do not give bra or jean sizes. If you have a large cup size or broad back, the size of the garment must be adjusted accordingly.</p>

						<p>Your authorized retailer can help you determine the size that is right for you. The style of the gown will often determine size as different silhouettes fit various body types. If your measurements fall between two sizes, the largest measurements must be considered first as well as the style you are ordering. Your authorized retailer will also help you determine which measurements would be easiest to alter. Remember, it's usually easier to take the garment in than to let it out when making alterations. And while it's always good to think positive, try not to overestimate the results of a diet program.</p>
						
						<p><strong>SKIRT LENGTHS</strong></p>

						<p>We offer different hem lengths on select styles such as knee, cocktail and floor length. We also offer extra length on select styles. Please check with your authorized retailer for individual style hem lengths and possible additional charges.</p>
						
						<p><strong>MATERNITY SIZES</strong></p>

						<p>Select bridesmaid styles are available for maternity . When ordering a dress, moms-to-be should discuss sizing needs with an authorized retailer.</p>

						<p><strong>FLOWER GIRL AND JR. BRIDESMAID SIZES</p></strong>

						<p>Flower Girls & Junior Bridesmaids sizes range from 2T to 14. Length measurements for flower girl and junior bridesmaid styles are based on waist to hem. We offer two different hem lengths on select styles—knee length or floor length. Please check with your authorized retailer for individual style hem lengths and possible additional charges. </p>

						<h2>
					        <span>Buyer Beware!</span>
					    </h2>
					    <p>Don't go for watered down dresses on the net or from an unauthorized dealer.</p>
				    </div>
				    <div class="content-template text-left padd-top-40">

						<p>The Internet is the perfect place to see what's out     there and narrow down your choices but we strongly recommend the     purchase of your dress be made through an authorized Sonias retail store   to   avoid many of the common pitfalls of bargain shopping for your big   day.   We have heard countless stories of cheap knock-offs sold by fly   by night   businesses or our dresses sold in less than perfect condition   by   middlemen posing as authorized dealers. </p>

						<p>Buying from an unauthorized dealer can ruin   your wedding day   and cost you more than you &ldquo;bargained&rdquo; for. Here are   some of the   problems you could be faced with: </p>

						<ul>
						  <li><i class="icon-task-check"></i> An incorrect style or size</li>
						  <li><i class="icon-task-check"></i> Wrong or different dye lots</li>
						  <li><i class="icon-task-check"></i> Defective garments</li>
						  <li><i class="icon-task-check"></i> Garments that have been worn</li>
						  <li><i class="icon-task-check"></i> Expensive "unforeseen" shipping or alteration costs</li>
						</ul>

						<p><strong> Or even worse…you may not receive your gown in time for the wedding!</strong></p>

						<p>Many of these sites or in-home dealers are   NOT LEGITIMATE Sonias   BRISES DEALERS . Avoid this at all costs! They   may lead you to believe   that they are A retail store, when they really   are working out of their   home, a P.O. Box or the trunk of their car. </p>

						<p><strong>What they will tell you: They can save you money because they do not have overhead expenses by operating a store-front.</strong></p>

						<p>Beware: Sonias ONLY SELLS garments to full   service bridal salons   that can provide you the utmost in service and   personal care you need.   Authorized Sonias retailers are known and   loved for offering honest advice   and delivering on their promises.   They'll help you find a dress that   fits your budget and makes your   day.</p>

						<p>A &ldquo;buying service&rdquo; that is ordering directly from Sonias when they are really buying your gown through a third party.</p>

						<p> <strong>What they will tell you: They can save offer big discounts because they do not have to stock sample dresses.</strong></p>

						<p>Beware: An authorized Sonias retailer will   carry samples of the Sonias   collections in their store for you to see,   touch and try on so you know   what looks good and feels good on your   body.</p>

						<p>Dealing directly with Sonias when in reality,   you are buying from   an unauthorized dealer who is selling you a   counterfeit dress, or has no   relationship with Sonias.</p>

						<p><strong>What they will tell you: They have   been working with   bridal gown manufacturers for years and can get you a   designer gown for   less than the retail price.</strong></p>

						<p>Beware: They can promise you all sorts of   savings. But what you   don't get is a promise that when something is   wrong with the fabric,   color, size, or when they miss your delivery   date all together, you   could be left with the stress and expense of a   last minute catastrophe.</p>

						<p>There are also charges and services to be   aware of with   internet purchases, such as shipping, pressing, and   unprofessional   alterations. This can often cost you more than you   would have paid if   you bought at full price through a full service   bridal salon.</p>

						<p>Sonias retailers are professional,   knowledgeable and highly trained   to sell our garments. They can   provide you with the best in knowledge   about the necessary size, fit   and alternations necessary for your gown   to fit you best without   spending a fortune.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately, not all seamstresses are   experienced in bridal   alternations. So when it comes down to buying   and getting fitted for   your dress, you'll thank yourself by dealing   directly with an authorized   Sonias retail store in-person.</p>
						
						<p>To verify whether a particular web site or   business is an   authorized Sonias retailer, you can visit our Store   Finder or Contact Us and   provide the name of the retailer, city and   state.</p>
						
						<p><strong>You get what you pay for Sonias. No worries</strong>! </p>
